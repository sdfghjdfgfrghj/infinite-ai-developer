## 🚀 What is This?

An AI system that takes natural language requirements and builds **complete, production-ready applications** through infinite iterations. Unlike other AI coding tools that generate single files or require constant human intervention, this system:

- 🔄 **Iterates infinitely** until the application is perfect (up to 1000 iterations)
- 🧪 **Tests everything automatically** - unit tests, integration tests, security, performance
- 🐛 **Debugs itself** - finds and fixes bugs through dedicated AI debugging cycles
- ✅ **Never gives up** - keeps improving until all quality gates are met
- 🎨 **Beautiful CLI** - professional interface with real-time progress and code display

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites Check
```bash
# Run the quick verification script
python3 quick_start.py
```

### 2. Install & Configure
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sdfghjdfgfrghj/infinite-ai-developer.git
cd infinite-ai-developer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install and start Ollama (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama serve

# Download a coding model
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b  # or qwen2.5-coder:32b for better results
```

### 3. Configure Your Model
Edit `orchestrator/policies.yaml`:
```yaml
model:
  host: "http://localhost:11434"
  name: "qwen2.5-coder:14b"  # or your preferred model
  timeout: 300
```

### 4. Build Your First App
```bash
# Simple test
python3 main_infinite.py test --simple

# Build a real application
python3 main_infinite.py build "Create a task manager CLI with file persistence"
```

## 📊 What It Actually Builds

**Current Status: Beta - Python Applications**

The system currently specializes in Python applications and has successfully built:
- ✅ **CLI Applications** - Task managers, calculators, utilities
- ✅ **Web APIs** - FastAPI applications with database integration
- ✅ **Desktop Scripts** - File processors, automation tools
- ✅ **Games** - Simple text-based and pygame applications

**Coming Soon:**
- 🚧 JavaScript/TypeScript web applications
- 🚧 Rust system applications
- 🚧 Multi-language projects

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Settings
```yaml
model:
  host: "http://localhost:11434"     # Ollama endpoint
  name: "qwen2.5-coder:14b"          # Model name
  timeout: 300                       # Request timeout

infinite:
  max_iterations: 1000               # Maximum iterations
  max_debug_cycles: 50               # Debug attempts per issue
  test_everything: true              # Test after every phase
```

### Recommended Models
- **qwen2.5-coder:32b** - Best results (requires 16GB+ RAM)
- **qwen2.5-coder:14b** - Good balance (requires 8GB+ RAM)
- **qwen2.5-coder:7b** - Faster, basic results (requires 4GB+ RAM)

## 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
# Build a calculator
python3 main_infinite.py build "Create a calculator with error handling and tests"

# Build a web API
python3 main_infinite.py build "Create a FastAPI todo list with SQLite database"

# Build a game
python3 main_infinite.py build "Create a text-based adventure game"

# Resume a project
python3 main_infinite.py resume run-abc123

# Check project status
python3 main_infinite.py status run-abc123
```
