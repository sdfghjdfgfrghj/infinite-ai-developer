## 🚀 What is This?

An AI system that takes natural language requirements and builds **complete, production-ready applications** through infinite iterations. Unlike other AI coding tools that generate single files or require constant human intervention, this system:

- 🔄 **Iterates infinitely** until the application is perfect (up to 1000 iterations)
- 🧪 **Tests everything automatically** - unit tests, integration tests, security, performance
- 🐛 **Debugs itself** - finds and fixes bugs through dedicated AI debugging cycles
- ✅ **Never gives up** - keeps improving until all quality gates are met
- 🎨 **Beautiful CLI** - professional interface with real-time progress and code display

## 💫 The Story Behind This Project

**Hi! I'm 16 years old and honestly, I'm not really good at coding yet.** 😅 

I have big dreams of creating amazing software, but I often get stuck on complex projects. I've tried building CLI agent IDEs, AI coding assistants, and even attempted to swap API calls in GPT Pilot with local AI models - but they were too complex and I couldn't make them work.

**That's exactly WHY I built this system!** 

I wanted an AI that could:
- 🎯 Take my ideas and actually build them completely
- 🔄 Never give up when things break (like I sometimes do)
- 🧪 Test everything so I know it actually works
- 🎨 Look professional so I can be proud to show it off
- 🤖 Help me learn by watching how it solves problems

**This isn't just a coding tool - it's my dream of democratizing software development.** If a 16-year-old who struggles with coding can build this, imagine what experienced developers can do with it!

## ⚡ Quick Start

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Settings
```yaml
model:
  host: "http://localhost:11434"     # Ollama endpoint
  name: "qwen2.5-coder:14b"          # Model name
  timeout: 300                       # Request timeout

infinite:
  max_iterations: 1000               # Maximum iterations
  max_debug_cycles: 50               # Debug attempts per issue
  test_everything: true              # Test after every phase
```

### Recommended Models
- **qwen2.5-coder:32b** - Best results (requires 16GB+ RAM)
- **qwen2.5-coder:14b** - Good balance (requires 8GB+ RAM)
- **qwen2.5-coder:7b** - Faster, basic results (requires 4GB+ RAM)

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

**Be aware of these current limitations:**
- **Python-focused** - Other languages coming soon
- **Local LLM required** - No cloud API support yet
- **Resource intensive** - Needs 8GB+ RAM for good models
- **Beta software** - May have bugs and rough edges (I'm still learning!)
- **Limited testing** - Needs more real-world validation

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Git operations may fail on some Windows/WSL setups
- Large projects (100+ files) may hit memory limits
- Some model responses may not parse correctly
- Docker integration is incomplete
- Code could probably be cleaner (I'm still learning best practices!)

## 💭 My Vision

**I dream of a world where anyone can build software, regardless of their coding skills.** 

This AI should eventually help:
- 🎓 **Students** like me who have ideas but struggle with implementation
- 👴 **My grandpa** who has great business ideas but can't code
- 🌍 **Anyone** who wants to create but feels limited by technical barriers

**If this project inspires you or helps you build something cool, please let me know!** It would mean the world to me. 💙
