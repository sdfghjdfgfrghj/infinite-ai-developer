## 🏗️ Architecture Guide

### Core Components

#### 1. **Orchestrator System** (`orchestrator/`)
- `infinite_orchestrator.py` - Main iteration engine
- `ai_orchestrator.py` - AI actor coordination
- `pipeline_states.py` - State management
- `policies.yaml` - Configuration

#### 2. **AI Actors** (`orchestrator/`)
Each AI actor has specific responsibilities:
```python
class NewAIActor:
    async def execute_phase(self, context):
        # Your AI actor logic here
        prompt = self.create_prompt(context)
        response = await self.model_client.call_ai_actor(
            role="your_role",
            user_message=prompt,
            context=context
        )
        return self.process_response(response)
```

#### 3. **UI System** (`ui/`)
- `beautiful_cli.py` - Rich-based interface components
- `live_monitor.py` - Real-time project monitoring

#### 4. **Tools** (`tools/`)
- `sandbox.py` - Isolated testing environment
- `repo_api.py` - Git and file operations

### Adding a New AI Actor

1. **Define the Actor Class**
```python
# orchestrator/actors/security_analyst.py
from .base_actor import BaseActor

class SecurityAnalyst(BaseActor):
    async def analyze_security(self, project_path: str):
        # Security analysis logic
        pass
```

2. **Add to Orchestrator**
```python
# orchestrator/infinite_orchestrator.py
async def _phase_security_analysis(self):
    security_analyst = SecurityAnalyst()
    results = await security_analyst.analyze_security(self.state.project_path)
    # Process results
```

3. **Update Pipeline**
```python
# Add to the phase sequence
PipelinePhase.SECURITY_ANALYSIS = "SECURITY_ANALYSIS"
```

### Adding Language Support

1. **Create Language Handler**
```python
# tools/languages/javascript_handler.py
class JavaScriptHandler:
    def generate_project_structure(self, requirements):
        # Generate package.json, etc.
        pass
    
    def run_tests(self, project_path):
        # Run npm test
        pass
```

2. **Update File Writer**
```python
# orchestrator/direct_file_writer.py
def detect_language(self, content):
    if content.startswith('const ') or 'function' in content:
        return 'javascript'
    # Add detection logic
```

## 📋 Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commits:
```
feat(orchestrator): add security analysis phase
fix(ui): resolve progress bar animation issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(sandbox): add integration tests for Docker
```

### Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test error conditions and edge cases

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports
Include:
- Python version and OS
- Model configuration (host, model name)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Full error logs

### Feature Requests
Include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Use cases and benefits
- Proposed implementation approach
- Any relevant examples or mockups

## 🎯 Development Tips

### Testing Your Changes
```bash
# Test with a simple project
python main_infinite.py build "Create a simple calculator" --max-iterations 10

# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/infinite_ai.log

# Run specific tests
python -m pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py -v
```

### Debugging
- Use the `--debug` flag for verbose logging
- Check `memory/states/` for saved project states
- Use the live monitor: `python main_infinite.py monitor`

### Performance
- Profile with `cProfile` for performance bottlenecks
- Monitor memory usage during long iterations
- Test with various model sizes and configurations
